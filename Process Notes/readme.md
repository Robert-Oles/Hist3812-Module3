# Process Notes #

When we entered this module I had originally planned to do something in minecraft to continue integrating my frankenstei-esc module but unforunatly my laptop had other plans. After completely bricking itself, I had to send my laptop in for repairs which I was originally told would take 1-5 business days but has now changed 9-12. SO, I had to change my plans and create something that I could do off of a Microsoft Surface tablet. 

So I feel back onto Twine and after we played Path of Honour in class and created a game about Martin Guerre Iw as pretty comfortable with what I wanted to make. I originally thought about creating a strictly narritive experience about the life of Louise McKinney but I wanted to try and talk about a broader topic. This is why I created an experience where you are forced to choose between labeling a figure or entity as good or evil, the logic being that it would warn players of the dangers of oversimplifing history to make it easily digestable. Which, had the added effect of warning about how personal bias and naritives impact what is considered to be "historically accurate representation" which sprang from our in-class discussion of Kingdom Come: Deliverance.

As for the actual steps to create this game: 

*Step One*
