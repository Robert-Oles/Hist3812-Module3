**Why has the resource been created and for what audience?**
Grand Librarian was created as an example of how someone with a low performance computer can create a videogame with the intent to create compelling content aimed at teaching history in new ways. 

**How will the resource be put to use? Is it sustainable and acessible?**
This resurce will be used to hopefully demonstrate to players how frustrating it can be to try and simplify complex topics into binary descriptors such as a good or evil. The intent of this is to make players recognize that teachers, news anchors and parents have been making these decisions about a wide vareity of topics for you. They have dictated the way you have seen the world and as such we must recognize the impact that the bias of these individuals may have had on the way that we see the world. 

**Why have you chosen to use this approach applied**
When my computer died, I was forced to come up with a creative way to demonstrate the point that I was trying to make. With more complex options off the table, a text based game became the best option. Furthermore, I didn't want this to be just a narriative experience where I directed the direction that players were to go. To go deeper, I created the Grand Librarian as a role-playing experience, I refused to use pictures or to try and force my model into the game because I wanted the player to project upon the game as much as possible. I wrote it as I would write a session of DND, with the players imagination in mind. This was based on the idea that in order for a game to be sucessfull "it immerses a player, so that she projects her mind—her sense of self—into it." (Kee, 2014 p.273).
